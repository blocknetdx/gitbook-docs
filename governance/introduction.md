# Introduction

[Blocknet](https://docs.blocknet.co/project/introduction) is a self-funded and community-governed project. Decentralization defines the template for group decision-making and is self-managed through a 2-part governing system consisting of Service Nodes and Superblocks. There is also additional funding aside from the Superblock, which is explained under [Community Funds](https://docs.blocknet.co/governance/introduction/#community-funds).
