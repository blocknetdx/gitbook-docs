# Upgrade Wallet

If you already have the Blocknet wallet installed and you're upgrading to the latest version, click here for instructions.

Before upgrading your Blocknet wallet to the latest version, close/quit/stop the Blocknet wallet app. If running the CLI wallet, issue the command, `./blocknet-cli stop` to stop the blocknet daemon.

Upgrading your wallet from version 4.0 or greater to the latest version is basically the same as installing the wallet from scratch. The differences are:

* When installing the upgrade version, your operating system may ask you to approve the replacement of your old Blocknet wallet app with the new one. (Select "OK" or "Replace")
* When running the upgrade version for the first time, you won't be prompted for an installation data directory as you were on initial installation.
* When running the upgrade version for the first time, you don't have to sync your wallet from scratch like you did on initial installation.
* When running the upgrade version for the first time, you won't have to encrypt your wallet as you did on initial installation."
