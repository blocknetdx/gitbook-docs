# Setup

This guide explains step-by-step how to setup a [Service Node](https://docs.blocknet.co/service-nodes/introduction). Operating a Service Node requires 5000 BLOCK collateral. This 5000 BLOCK collateral will still be in your wallet and in your control, but must not be moved or spent in order for the Service Node to remain valid and active. However, you may still use this collateral to participate in staking.

Operating as a Service Node requires two Blocknet wallets:

* **Collateral Wallet** - This wallet will contain the 5000 BLOCK collateral and does _NOT_ need to remain online and unlocked unless the 5000 BLOCK is being staked or you are [voting on a proposal](https://docs.blocknet.co/governane/proposal-voting).
* **Service Node Wallet** - This wallet will act as the Service Node and must remain online and open at all times.
